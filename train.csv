Action,We are asking every shop around the BAY ISLANDS to do at least one dive on Sunday that is a specific cleanup dive!
Information,"Turtle meat is still consumed throughout the island and people use nets and spears to catch them. This net was most likely from Crawfish Rock as we have had numerous reports of them from community members. There are undoubtedly dozens more turtle nets being used around Roatan so we ask all boat owners to keep on the look out for lines of small floats inside lagoons , indicating a net. One can only imagine how many turtles have sadly died in this net but thankfully it has now been destroyed and can no longer kill our hawksbill and green turtles."
Information,"these guys are all alive and as well as can be hoped. to ensure that the iguanas don't escape, they rip out the nail from each foot and tie them together, using the tendon as rope. Not very nice for the iguanans but at least these guys were all well enough to scamper off into the bushes once released"

Community,"Clay Fowler I will give you a bit of background. There is an Acuerdo (002-2004 art. 35) that states that no plastics, bottles, bags or packaging shall be introduced into The Bay Islands without the necessary removal efforts in place. As of June of this year we have had the 4 biggest supermarkets ban plastic bags. They are now slowly and surely bringing them back as there are no municipal sanctions in place, even though we have had this Acuerdo since 2004! \nWe, the RMP, want to show the municipality the support this initiative has from the communities. \nSo I ask again... would you sign a petition to save our ecosystems?"

Information,"Well Chris, the Roatan Marine Park has been and is still very involved in improving Honduran Environmental Laws. Things don't change over night in first world countries so you can imagine how hard it can be here with lots of conflict of interest in many cases. The SAD photo you post its a true reality and we have extensive awareness programs with kids and we are just starting to create an awareness program thru diving and its not just something random this is the way for many local people to realize their treasure.  But the true strength of the RMP comes from the united effort of Hotels, Dive shops and other stake holders that depend of the Island. And let me just rephrase united. We have touched all the government levels that are in charge of actually punishing this acts and in this year we have had success on the response and prosecution. Strong fines had been given and some projects have been stopped. But as I mentioned before we need to work United and we cant stop all of the bad things that affect the reef but we definitely make a difference.We want to stop problems like this every one should together as part of this Island. If someone has a report contact us as soon as you can and we will gather information or  detain and then send it to the government office that has the responsibility prosecute, we will follow up. If you want to know more about all the activities, projects, funds, and government relations please contact us, or come to our general Assembly which will be in March and will post the exact date on our Facebook page. All together we make the difference not alone."

Information,Here is the approximate location of where the boat with the 8 passengers where found
Information,"Sea cucumbers, named for their resemblance to the vegetable cucumber, are echinoderms and are in the same phylum as starfish, sea urchins, and sand dollars. They are found at every ocean depth and worldwide there are approximately 1250 species. They can be anywhere from 3 millimetres to 1 metre in length but are typically 10-30cm long. \nSea cucumbers serve a useful purpose in the marine ecosystem as they help recycle nutrients. They are generally scavengers, feeding on decaying organic matter, however some feed on plankton. Therefore they play an integral part in marine ecosystems, almost similar to that of lobster and conch, and cannot be disregarded as being unimportant. \nFor centuries sea cucumbers have been harvested for human consumption with some species cultivated in commercial aquaculture systems. They are mostly exported in a dried form, but a small quantity of fresh and frozen sea cucumber also enters into international trade. Nearly 90% are consumed in Southeast Asia and the Far East and in general consumption is associated with high quality dried and prepared/preserved seafood such as shark fins, abalone and other shellfish. In Dalian, the largest sea cucumber trading hub in China, the industry is estimated at $1.6 billion per year, meaning global estimates are much greater. \nIn the past year, with the closure of the lobster diving fishery In Honduras, fishermen have been looking for alternatives and have heard of the possible riches in harvesting sea cucumbers. There have been numerous cases throughout Roatan of boats packed full of free divers collecting sea cucumbers and fortunately, on several occasions we were able to intervene and release the sea cumbers.  According to the Bay Islands Management Plan, it is illegal to remove and commercialize shells, hard and soft corals, seas cucumbers, starfish, sea urchins, seahorses, sponges, turtles, sharks and all sub products. This law is for the whole of the Bay Islands, therefore we ask that you report any boats or individuals collecting sea cucumbers so we can collaborate with the authorities and stop this from happening."

These structures would provide sanctuary for many people not only in the US, where you might not see it as a viable option, but worldwide where there are people suffering due to lack of basic human rights. \n\nBrain surgery it is not but common sense would tell you that this is a great option for many people especially in countries where recycling is not even an option."

Community,"Roberto Mejia Astorga Just so you know, It has absolutely nothing to do with poor vs rich! It is not fishing that is illegal, it is the way they are fishing... Handlines (rod and reel included) are legal... Spears are not! Also, the fish that the sport fishers catch are open water, migratory fish (for the most part) that have no direct impact on the reef that so many of us rely on. So let's make that difference crystal clear and protect the reef!"

Community,Photo of the Week. Thank you Peter Hughes for this precious hawksbill profile!
Information,"Dear Jon, Thank you for generating the opportunity to clarify your points in an objective manner.\n1. Performance requirements are limited to buoyancy control and proper aiming and shooting skills with the Hawaiian Slings. Additionally, we have a liability release form which also states that you are aware that the Hawaiian Sling is intended for lionfish and lionfish only, and that if you are caught with anything else, you\u2019ll be in trouble.\n2. The most immediate sites to be impacted are those located within the Sandy Bay \u2013 West End area and also on the Southside from West all the way East bordering Oakridge; this shoreline, all the way until 60 m below sea level. Other project regarding lionfish control is being started with Punta Gorda (North-East) community members. \nAlthough the above are represents RMP\u2019s immediate jurisdiction boundaries, the new regulations are being designed to fit within a general Management Plan for the whole Bay Islands National Marine Park (all three islands). Therefore, one of the main drivers of change regarding for the Lionfish Program is the need to standardize the program within the three islands.\n3. Unfortunately, lionfish data from independent lionfish hunters is hard to standardize and make plausible conclusions based on it. But, lionfish population data is indeed being collected by the RMP along with other institutional partners through a monitoring system called AGRRA (Atlantic and Rapid Reef Assesment). Through this periodic monitoring system we evaluate the reef\u2019s health based on distinct indicators classified into benthic cover, invert biota, commercial fish biomass, and herbivorous fish biomass. Lionfish population is accounted for here. In the West \u2013 North portion of Roatan we have 8 permanent monitoring sites. \nThe data above is being collected and important publications are already available online (http://www.healthyreefs.org/index.php/en/)\nAt the moment, we are developing parallel monitoring systems regarding poaching pressure in order to correlate patrolling efficiency & reef\u2019s health, in a way where we may actually quantify our management success or failure, and to promote adaptive management based on pertinent scientific data.\nWe have no scientific conclusions regarding lionfish impact yet, but on a subjective appreciation we do recognize that populations have been declaiming within popular dive sites where lionfish hunters are active. \n4. Data to be collected after the new rules are enforced will depend only in the willingness of the licensed hunters to provide it \u2013 we have the intention of developing and promoting an interactive webpage were you may login key data that will allow us to estimate catch rates vs. man/hour effort in specific sites. \n 5. No data has been really collected from current lionfish hunters.\n6. We do need to be flexible and that is the spirit of our \u201cadaptive management concept\u201d, we change in response of objective experience.\n7. Lionfish numbers are clearly not the focus of these new rules, the damage being done to the reef by inexperienced divers with poor buoyancy control are the issue being addressed = RMP\u2019s point of view.\nOnce again Jon, thank you for your time in generating this important questions. I hope you may help us set these new rules in place and of course, I\u2019ll let you know when the lionfish hunter\u2019s portal is available for you to enter your own catch data. Best, Andr\xe9s."

We consider this to be the cause of death as there was no other evidence of the shark being tangled or having any other injuries. Keep our sharks safe. They are an important part of our eco system.

Community,"Good morning, \nThere are many theories behind what is best for the turtle's navigation and magnetism. What we do is give them a rest at Maya Key and then we will release them in the open ocean on some of the sargassum as to not mess with their established imprint of their natal beach. \nWe have yet to make a trip into the open ocean on one of these releases but we will have to soon as we have quite a few babies. \nSo, to answer your question, please bring them in or feel free to put them back but if you choose the latter please head out a couple miles so they don't get washed right back onto the beach!"

The other species in the Avoid Eating category play important roles in the reef ecosystem like eating algae and being the predators thus keeping lionfish in their place\nThe Choices with Caution are either seasonal like lobster or more abundant on the reef. They are on the yellow bc we will determine if, over the years, they will jump to the green or fall to the red!\nBest Choices are mostly open water fish that don't impact the reef, have healthy numbers in the wild and reach maturity at an early age. and then we have Lionfish... Lionfish are taking over but the fishermen are steadily selling a few hundred pounds a month with all the members of the program!"

Information,"When Jacques-Yves Cousteau first saw the blue ocean through a pair of glass goggles back in 1936, this where his thoughts:\n \n\u201cI was astounded by what I saw in the shallow shingle at Le Mourillon, rocks covered with green, brown and silver forests of algae and fishes unknown to me, swimming in crystalline water. Standing up to breathe I saw a trolley car, people, electric-light poles. I put my eyes under again and civilization vanished with one last bow. I was in a jungle never seen by those who floated on the opaque roof.\u201d\n \nThis is a gentle reminder that every time each of us ventures into our underwater jungles, we must behave properly, and demand that our companions do so as well, just as anyone would in an art museum \u2013 only seeing, never grabbing. Little by little, unsupervised people are impacting our delicate corals. \n\nIf we don\u2019t take supervision seriously, our submarine jungle will soon not look any better than an electric light pole in Coxen Hole!"

Comparing % of divers who buy the fee would be a more precise method of measurement but that would be an impossible figure to acquire"
Information,"large nets will have white styrofoam buoys keeping it afloat, however the smaller ones will seem more inconspicuos as the floats are much smaller and often blue. Keep a look our for sticks stuck into the sand, seagrass, mud or even the reef which are used to keep the net in one place.  Straight or curved lines in the water may often indicate a net floating just at the water line"

This is a perfect time to remind all tour operators, boat owners and all local businesses about safety in the marine park and why life jackets are so important.

Information,"We will be doing refreshers for Eldon's and PM plus HiperMega, Isleno and Rey sometime this month!"
Information,"Yesterday, Nov 11th, there was an incident involving a large fishing boat. The boat had traveled to Roat\xe1n and was collecting sea cucumbers around French Key. \nUpon receiving several calls from concerned residents, the RMP patrol boat approached the boat, which was acting like a mother ship for smaller \u201cCayucos\u201d (non-motored dories) delivering their catch. The Park Rangers, accompanied by RMP staff and the Municipal Police, ordered the captain to stop harvesting until the issue regarding proper permits and jurisdiction could be resolved. The cayucos were ordered to return to the boat and release their catch of sea cucumbers into the ocean. \n\nWe were unable to inspect the main vessel, as neither the RMP nor the Municipal Police are permitted to do so. According to the Management Plan for the Bay Islands National Marine Park, it is illegal to harvest and commercialize any seas cucumbers within the Bay Island\u2019s National Marine Park boundaries. However, the vessel had been issued a permit no. 092-2012, by the Secretaria de Agricultura y Ganaderia that house the Fisheries Department, from the mainland, allowing them to do so, therefore going against the regulations stated in the current and legal management plan.\n\nThe boat has now left the Bay Islands and the Roat\xe1n Marine Park has involved all the authorities, including the ministry of ICF and the ministry of Environment for upholding the laws of the management plan."

Community,"As posted above... lack of interest was not the correct term, it has been more like lack of participation! Monty Graham The staff members are constantly picking up trash. On our walks home, on our snorkel trips, with schools, with our volunteers... also we have 2 Instructors on our staff as well and a divemaster and being as such we clean up underwater on our dives as well! \n\nWe applaud you and your diveshop for cleaning as you teach and dive; but the truth of the matter is that not everyone does. \n\nThe reason this post semana santa cleanup came about is b/c people were complaining about the trash left behind in the whirlwind of unknowing tourists. The RMP is swamped but, if we have concerned community members we will try our best to accommodate them however, we ask that they (the complainers) also help out and be a part of the solution and not the problem.

Information,Thanks for you concern. We have been observing this activity all ready because its new for us. Now as your link says they are working on regulations in the States so you can imagine here we have none. We have approached the owner/instructor and expressed to him that our main concern is the safety of who does the activity. This is because its been done on the navigation area of West Bay. Environmentally the risk is to the turtle grass but what I have been seeing is that he stays within the sand patch. We have expressed to him that he needs to stay away from the coral reef.

Sharpnose puffers contain tetrodotoxin which is  toxic to most fish and may have caused the Goggle-Eyes' death. \n\nWITH THIS IN MIND PLEASE IF YOU SEE THESE PUFFERS ON THE BEACH EITHER BURY THEM OR PICK THEM UP!

Information,"Thank you Healthy Reefs for Healthy People for launching the Mesoamerican Reef 2015 Report Card today. We were delighted to hear that Honduras was the best ranked from the 4 countries of the Mesoamerican reef, Honduras is ranked at 3.3 on a scale of 1-5 where 1 is ""poor"" and 5 is ""very good"" due to the high live coral cover and high herbivorous fish. The Bay Islands, Swan Islands and Cayos Cochinos were the only subregions to have a ""very good"" and Roatan and Cayos Cochinos scored higher for commercial biomass. Thanks to Honduras' ban on spear and trap fishing we have managed to protect our parrotfish. Our long standing MPA protection, gear restrictions and effective enforcement have contributed to the groupers recovering. Increasing protection for large fish will allow them to grow bigger and produce more off spring, while effective management of Marine Protected Areas generates increased fish biomass and high coral cover provides the structure to support more fish. By following the fisheries rules and regulations, reefs and fishermen will have more fish. It's good to know we are really making a difference, let's keep up the good work!"

It is also used to share cleaning techniques and offer opportunities to local communities on where and how they can sell their catch!
