Information,"Mark Havey Award of Conservation Excellence\nThis award is granted to one influential community member every 4 years.  \nThe recipient is chosen by the Roatan Marine Park Board of Directors and Staff Members based on their contributions to conservation within Roatan and the Bay Islands.  The recipient will be well respected in their field by their peers as well as looked on as a role model within not only their community but within the conservation community and family. \n\nAfter much thought we have unanimously decided that the first ever recipient of the Mark Havey Award of Conservation Excellence will be Mr. Sherman Arch of French Cay. \n\nMr. Sherman began his conservation efforts when he opened his house and property to the preserve the Green Iguana population. Then he expanded his area of conservation to include rescued monkeys, parrots and raccoons and eventually onto the marine area mainly by purchasing sea turtles and keeping them until they could be released safely back onto the reef.  \n\nCurrently he along with family and 10 or so other community members of French Cay have dedicated their lives to protect the bay surrounding Big and Little French Cay. \n\nThank you Mr. Sherman for everything you have done and will do to make Roatan a better place!"

Otherwise, you normally can get a ferry to Puerto Cortes and jump on a cargo ship from there to here. Now if you would rather fly the best option would be to San Pedro then from San Pedro to Roatan direct, TACA is the airline to try for this option."

Do they have conch on their menu?  and are any of the Responsible Seafood Guide materials visible to you to help you make a responsible choice?"
Information,"It is clear that people who are not earning a living from all the tourism generated revenue here on Roatan rely on the sea as a source of food and income. What was once full of conch, lobster, turtles and fish, due to such an increase in the island's population, there are far fewer of all of these inhabitants on the reef. Overfishing is a huge problem here with juveniles of all species of fish harvested, along with the use of nets and spearguns. The reefs are struggling with this increased pressure and the future looks bleak if we don't work more on controlling the ever increasing population who fail to receive the education and awareness which would change their attitude towards the reefs"

Community,"Hello everyone thanks for all your comments. We do patrols during day and also strategic at night some of them are by land others by sea. We try to change our strategies because believe or not poachers are very creative and always find new ways to do their activities. Our rangers normally as soon the capture live organisms the free them around the area that they got them now in this case in my position as Director and coordinator of patrols and seeing the different methods they used I asked the ranger to bring them to West End so I could inspect the animals, take pictures of them in and out the bag and write an adequate report, I decided to release them on Half Moon Bay to avoid more stress to them. Now I want to be clear that this is not a common approach we do believe in releasing them close to the area they where found and we spread them, the only other time we move them is when they are in the popular poaching sites then we find other site where we can insure their survival. I ask the community to not only report this cases to us but also make sure that if poaches come close to your beach let them know that you wont tolerate their activities. Only together we will make a difference. RMP main objective is preserving the Islands treasures and will work hard to achieve it. Thank You for understanding and great job to our ranger that found this bags and conch."

Some people hate zoos as they house wild animals which were taken from their homes.

Community,"As for the plastic law, it states that companies that import must either make it easy for removal (recycling) or be taxed per unit. They have made an effort to offer recycling and pay for not only their plastic but cans as well. This DOES NOT include the picking up of the plastic... just the effort to remove it from the island... they are the MAIN reason why Roatan recycles anything... just the yes this is a sneaky way but those are our laws and unfortunately it gives the companies loopholes and even if it was perfectly enforced by the municipality it still would not solve the plastic and trash on our beaches and streets! That is where the communities of Roatan must step up and help out ourselves... if we dont help and respect ourselves, who will?? and why would they?"

Community,Awww... think about this one for a while...
Information,"Every year thousands of marine species die from contact with ocean-borne plastic bags. The animals may mistake the bags for food, such as jellyfish, or simply become entangled. Plastic bags can take up to 1,000 years to break down, so even when an animal dies and decays after ingesting a bag, the plastic re-enters the environment, posing a continuing threat to wildlife. \r\nWhile most plastic bags eventually break down into tiny particles, smaller sea creatures may still eat the sand-sized fragments and concentrate toxic chemicals in their bodies.\r\n\r\nTrying to reduce the use of plastic bags and its negative impact the RMP has of officially launched the Bags for Life Campaign.\r\nYou can purchase your Bag for Life at the RMP Eco - Store, Eldons supermarket, Mangiamo, and Plaza Mar.\r\n\r\nReduce your Footprint\r\n\r\nSay no to Plastic!!!"

Information,"Short Message to business owners prior to Semana Santa!\n\nThe Honduran Swan Islands constitute a chain of three small islands located in the northwestern Caribbean Sea, approximately ninety miles off the Honduran coastline. They are the most isolated islands in the region, meaning that they are located as far away from any other island in the Caribbean.\n\nWhile on a scientific expedition, last July I had the privilege of visiting this remote place, hoping to encounter a pristine area where few people have ventured. Although the scene in the Northern portions of the islands where astoundingly beautiful, the story wasn\u2019t the same in the South Side. \n\nEven when only 6 navy officers actually live in the island, the South beaches where unexpectedly covered with plastic trash brought upon the currents. Our cultural bond with plastics is evidently taking the lead, destroying ecosystems and places that we might not even know about yet.\n\nWhether you own a business or not, the message for this Semana Santa, is for all of us to make a little sacrifice and accept to comply with this very simple recommendations.\n\nPlease don\u2019t sell plastic bottles! Alternatives are always there:\n\na. Sell refreshments in cans (which are more reciclable tan plastics).\n\nb. Serve sodas or beers in \u201ccarton\u201d cups, not plastics.\n\nc. If you which to sell water, buy enough 5 gallon containers and get a fountain \u2013 instead, sell re-fills.\n\nd. If you sell food, use and sell them in \u201ccarton\u201d plates, not plastics.\n\ne. Please give enough garbage cans available for your customers.\n\nWe are counting with you to make a difference. Thanks!\nAndr\xe9s\n\n(photos below: Kip Evans)"
